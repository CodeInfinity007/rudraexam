The code attached is for the meeting scheduler problem given.

How to use:
1. Enter how many persons use the app
2. Enter name of each person who use the app
3. Now when scheduling a meeting select the people who will attend the meeting
4. The code will then check if the persons selected are available for the meeting or not, and if they are they will be added to the meeting list.
5. App is restartable so we can check the second time that the ppl who were selected in the meeting in the first time should be shown busy this time.
